This project is part of my journey in The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css) that consists of rebuilding Google homepage.

I've used the CSS Grid for the scaffold of the webpage then applied flex to the grid content in order to justify and align the elements.
